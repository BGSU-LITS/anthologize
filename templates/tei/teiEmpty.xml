                                >a story</a> yesterday about <a
                                href="http://www.facebook.com/terms.php?ref=pf">Facebook's new Terms
                                of Service</a>. The gist of the changes appears to be something like
                            this. Facebook has always claimed rights to the content that you post
                            there. But there used to be a clause stating that </p><blockquote>You
                            may remove your User Content from the Site at any time. If you choose to
                            remove your User Content, the license granted above will automatically
                            expire, however you acknowledge that the Company may retain archived
                            copies of your User Content.</blockquote> Now this clause is gone. Thus
                        Facebook has legal ("irrevocable, perpetual, non-exclusive, transferable,
                        fully paid, worldwide") rights to your content. <p>On a personal note, these
                            terms apply even to the content created by those individuals who place a
                            Share This link on their personal sites, whether or not they are the
                            ones who post the content on Facebook. I have a hard time believing that
                            this would qualify as a <a
                                href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unconscionability">conscionable
                                contract</a>, but I'm not a lawyer so what do I know. In any case,
                            this means that I'll be removing the Share on Facebook link from this
                            blog.</p>
                        <p>The educational ramifications are important, I think. <a
                                href="http://twitter.com/academicdave/status/1215456839"
                                >@academicdave</a> tweeted the following this morning:
                            </p><blockquote>Just realized that facebook now owns the rights to one
                            of my students recent projects (story told using facebook) even if they
                            delete it.</blockquote> This is a troubling thought. Instructors have a
                        responsibility to their students and the work that those students do, and
                        requiring that the students give essentially unlimited rights to their work
                        to a corporate entity does not seem to me to be coincident with this
                        responsibility. Of course, it was already the case that Facebook retained
                        rights to these items before this TOS update, but the fact that these rights
                        are now irrevocable, in my view, makes the question qualitatively different.
                        Different enough that, while I used to be eager to talk to faculty members
                        about how they might incorporate Facebook into their classes, I'm not
                        certain that I can continue to do so with a clear conscience. There are lots
                        of alternative spaces in which to share content where the restrictions
                        aren't so harsh. <p>Again, I'm not a lawyer, but I would be interested in
                            knowing how the act of publishing something on Facebook, and the
                            transfer of rights that it implies, interacts with any <em>explicit</em>
                            licenses (e.g. Creative Commons) that you have given the content,
                            especially where the Facebook license and the CC license are in
                            disagreement with each other. Does anyone know anything about this?</p>
                        <p>I also wonder whether there will be sufficient backlash among the users
                            of Facebook to make the company reconsider this updated TOS. I am
                            pessimistic. My sense is that most people who use Facebook heavily
                            aren't thinking about this sort of issue.</p></body>

                        <p>It's always been tough explaining to my family what I do. 'Student' they
                            understand; 'graduate student' is easy enough by extension. 'Philosophy'
                            is hit-and-miss. While the folk (i.e. my folks) has an sense that
                            philosophy involves far-out, abstract thinking (and maybe a pipe and
                            leather elbow patches), it's harder to grasp what it means to write a
                            dissertation on the subject. Trying to explain the specific nature of
                            the problems I'm interested in, or even how my subdiscipline is
                            delineated, is a non-starter. It takes lots of setup for the problems to
                            make sense, and lots of persuasion to convince that the problems are
                            worthy of a research program. This is either a testament to the erudite
                            nature of philosophy, the pointlessness of philosophy, or my ineptitude
                            as an explainer. (I am indifferent between these possibilities.)

                            a new spiel this Christmas Eve, trying to explain my new job as an
                            educational technologist. In some ways it's easier. When I tell them
                            that it has to do with computers they usually glaze over and that's
                            that. (Unlike, incidentally, when I tell people that I'm doing
                            philosophy and they really want to engage in a philosophical discussion
                            with me. Seriously, what is up with that? I just want to drink this
                            Blatz and eat this venison sausage and not think about Kripke for like
                            ten minutes.) Of course, when I try to dodge the question with the "work
                            with computers" line, I'm sure the position they imagine is something
                            very different from what I actually do (they probably envision the
                            administrator that Jim Groom describes <a
                                href="http://bavatuesdays.com/what-is-an-instructional-technologist/"
                                >here</a>). Does it make me cynical that I don't care to disillusion
                            them? Seriously, I just want to drink this Blatz and eat this venison
                            sausage and not think about pedagogy for like ten minutes. I'm curious
                            to know how other people deal with the "What do you do?" question, when
                            "what you do" is not well-defined by the kinds of categories familiar
                            to, say, my grandfather.</p>

                        <p>This plugin adds a widget to your WPMU blog that allows the blog
                            administrator to display a list of links from any blog on the
                            installation. Imagine, for instance, that Josie is teaching a class in
                            which she and each of her students have individual blogs. Josie's got a
                            list of important links (a class blogroll, or maybe links that are
                            relevant to the class), and she'd like to share the links with her
                            students. Using this plugin, her students can place a widget on their
                            blogs that automatically pulls in a certain category of links from her
                            blog.</p>

                        <a
                            href="http://localhost/workspace/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/shared-blogroll.jpg">

                        </a>

                        <p>At the moment, the plugin works like this: Drop the Shared Blogroll
                            widget into one of your blog's sidebars. You'll need to know the blog_id
                            of the blog from which you'll be pulling the links. (This is the big
                            weakness in the plugin for now. For the moment, I'll probably add a line
                            of code to the Dashboard that echoes the global $blog_id, so that blog
                            owners will know their blog_id and be able to pass it along to other who
                            want to share their links. In the future I may add autocomplete or
                            something. If you have a suggestion, let me know.) Once you've entered
                            the source blog id, the plugin automatically populates the Category
                            dropdown list with the categories from the source blog, so if you only
                            want to include one of the link categories you can. You can have as many
                            shared blogroll widgets on a blog as you'd like.</p>

                        <p>This plugin ives members the ability to upload attachments on their
                            posts.</p>

                        <p>It's a port of a plugin originally created for bbPress by _ck_. See the
                            original plugin page here: <a
                                href="http://bbpress.org/plugins/topic/bb-attachments"
                                >http://bbpress.org/plugins/topic/bb-attachments/</a>. _ck_ is not
                            supporting this plugin anymore. Insofar as the code works, it is thanks
                            to her; insofar as it does not, it is my fault.</p>

                        <h2>Installation</h2>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Upload to plugin directory and activate</li>
                            <li>If you'd like to change the default settings (as described in step 5
                                here <a
                                    href="http://bbpress.org/plugins/topic/bb-attachments/installation/"
                                    >http://bbpress.org/plugins/topic/bb-attachments/installation/</a>),
                                you may do so by editing
                                forum-attachments-for-buddypress-bp-functions.php</li>
                            <li>Create a directory 'bb-attachments' one level above your WP root and
                                make sure that it is writeable by the server. So if your WP
                                installation is at /home/html/, create a directory
                                /home/bb-attachments.</li>

                            <li>I use a JavaScript trick to make uploads possible. If you are
                                confident that most of your users will have JS enabled, you do not
                                need to do anything else.</li>
                            <li>If you want to make uploads possible for users with JS turned off,
                                you will need to alter the &lt;form&gt; tags on your theme's forum
                                files: <strong>groups/single/forum/topic.php</strong> and
                                    <strong>groups/single/forum.php</strong>. Change [code
                                    language="html"]<form action="" method="post"
                                    id="forum-topic-form" class="standard-form">[/code] to [code
                                    language="html"]</form><form action="" method="post"
                                    id="forum-topic-form" class="standard-form"
                                    enctype="multipart/form-data">[/code]</form></li>
                            <li>If you have an unusual setup (in particular, if your WP_PLUGIN_URL
                                is somewhere other than /wp-content/) you may have to play with the
                                path settings in download.php and image.php to make things work
                                correctly.</li>
