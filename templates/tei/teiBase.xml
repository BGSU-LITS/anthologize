                        <p>This plugin adds two widgets to your WordPress MU/BuddyPress

                            Members widgets that ship with BuddyPress. They provide the ability to
                            select which of the three tabs - Newest, Active, or Popular - will be
                            the widget's default view.</p>

                                >a story</a> yesterday about <a
                                href="http://www.facebook.com/terms.php?ref=pf">Facebook's new Terms
                                of Service</a>. The gist of the changes appears to be something like
                            this. Facebook has always claimed rights to the content that you post
                            there. But there used to be a clause stating that </p><blockquote>You
                            may remove your User Content from the Site at any time. If you choose to
                            remove your User Content, the license granted above will automatically
                            expire, however you acknowledge that the Company may retain archived
                            copies of your User Content.</blockquote> Now this clause is gone. Thus
                        Facebook has legal ("irrevocable, perpetual, non-exclusive, transferable,
                        fully paid, worldwide") rights to your content. <p>On a personal note, these
                            terms apply even to the content created by those individuals who place a
                            Share This link on their personal sites, whether or not they are the
                            ones who post the content on Facebook. I have a hard time believing that
                            this would qualify as a <a
                                href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unconscionability">conscionable
                                contract</a>, but I'm not a lawyer so what do I know. In any case,
                            this means that I'll be removing the Share on Facebook link from this
                            blog.</p>
                        <p>The educational ramifications are important, I think. <a
                                href="http://twitter.com/academicdave/status/1215456839"
                                >@academicdave</a> tweeted the following this morning:
                            </p><blockquote>Just realized that facebook now owns the rights to one
                            of my students recent projects (story told using facebook) even if they
                            delete it.</blockquote> This is a troubling thought. Instructors have a
                        responsibility to their students and the work that those students do, and
                        requiring that the students give essentially unlimited rights to their work
                        to a corporate entity does not seem to me to be coincident with this
                        responsibility. Of course, it was already the case that Facebook retained
                        rights to these items before this TOS update, but the fact that these rights
                        are now irrevocable, in my view, makes the question qualitatively different.
                        Different enough that, while I used to be eager to talk to faculty members
                        about how they might incorporate Facebook into their classes, I'm not
                        certain that I can continue to do so with a clear conscience. There are lots
                        of alternative spaces in which to share content where the restrictions
                        aren't so harsh. <p>Again, I'm not a lawyer, but I would be interested in
                            knowing how the act of publishing something on Facebook, and the
                            transfer of rights that it implies, interacts with any <em>explicit</em>
                            licenses (e.g. Creative Commons) that you have given the content,
                            especially where the Facebook license and the CC license are in
                            disagreement with each other. Does anyone know anything about this?</p>
                        <p>I also wonder whether there will be sufficient backlash among the users
                            of Facebook to make the company reconsider this updated TOS. I am
                            pessimistic. My sense is that most people who use Facebook heavily
                            aren't thinking about this sort of issue.</p></body>
